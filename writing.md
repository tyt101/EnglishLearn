##### Topic：What are some things you use to do when you were younger? Do you do them now? Why or why not?

when I was a child, I used to pick up stones on my way from school to home, play in the mud in my grandmother's field, I really like all kinds of beautiful and crystal clear stones in the past, I still like them but don't pick up stones now. because I can't find the interesting of picking up stones with my Childhood friend, also as I grew up, I witnessed the changes of the city, the city streets changed a lot, I never walked the road that I used to pick up stones. when I gone to my grandmother's home where is a small villege, I usually play in the mud with my siblings, we used mud to create mechines , for example telephones, interphones. That's the best memorize of my childhood but I don't do that now, because we all grew up, we have many other things to do, more activities to attend, and the way of getting happiness had changed, also we have being a long time to leave hometown.

When I was a child, I used to pick up stones on my way from school to home and play in the mud in my grandmother's field. Back then, I liked all kinds of beautiful and crystal-clear stones in the past. While I still like them, I no longer pick stones up because I can't find the interesting of picking up stones with my Childhood friend, as I grew older, I witnessed the changes in the city, the city streets changed a lot, I never walked the road that I used to pick up stones. 

When I went to my grandmother's home which was a small village, I used to play in the mud with my sister, we used mud to mold machines, for example, telephones, walkie talkies. That's the best memory of my childhood. However, I don't do that now because we have all grown up, we have many other things to do, more activities to attend, and the way of getting happiness has changed, we have been a long time to leave our hometown.

### How is medicine or the price of medicine different in you native country?

As far as I know, the price of medicine is increasing those years. I still remember
the 999 cold medicine only need 9.9 RMB in the past but it has been increased to 19.9,
people are more afraid of having a sick as they can't afford the price of looking for a doctor. Besides, there are more and more liars who sell supplements to the aged.
but fortunately, our government is making plans to solve these problems, it reminds people to be aware of supplements scam in our daily life. also lots of people don't need to worry about desease cost thanks to medical insurance , also there are many free medical services in every hospital or some online doctors.
