##### Topic：What are some things you use to do when you were younger? Do you do them now? Why or why not?

when I was a child, I used to pick up stones on my way from school to home, play in the mud in my grandmother's field, I really like all kinds of beautiful and crystal clear stones in the past, I still like them but don't pick up stones now. because I can't find the interesting of picking up stones with my Childhood friend, also as I grew up, I witnessed the changes of the city, the city streets changed a lot, I never walked the road that I used to pick up stones. when I gone to my grandmother's home where is a small villege, I usually play in the mud with my siblings, we used mud to create mechines , for example telephones, interphones. That's the best memorize of my childhood but I don't do that now, because we all grew up, we have many other things to do, more activities to attend, and the way of getting happiness had changed, also we have being a long time to leave hometown.

When I was a child, I used to pick up stones on my way from school to home and play in the mud in my grandmother's field. Back then, I liked all kinds of beautiful and crystal-clear stones in the past. While I still like them, I no longer pick stones up because I can't find the interesting of picking up stones with my Childhood friend, as I grew older, I witnessed the changes in the city, the city streets changed a lot, I never walked the road that I used to pick up stones. 

When I went to my grandmother's home which was a small village, I used to play in the mud with my sister, we used mud to mold machines, for example, telephones, walkie talkies. That's the best memory of my childhood. However, I don't do that now because we have all grown up, we have many other things to do, more activities to attend, and the way of getting happiness has changed, we have been a long time to leave our hometown.
