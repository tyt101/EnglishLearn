###  read exercise

The red wolf, a unique type of wolf in the USA, is making a slow comeback thanks to a breeding program.

Point Defiance(/dɪˈfaɪəns/) Zoo in Tacoma(/təˈkoʊmə/), Washington(/ˈwɑːʃɪŋtən/), helps by looking after their teeth. Broken teeth can make it hard for these wolves to eat properly(/ˈprɑːpərli/). Around 270 red wolves remain, most in zoos, and only 20 in the wild in eastern North Carolina(/ˌkærəˈlaɪnə/). The zoo’s vets(/vets/) gave the wolves dental checkups and cleaned their teeth. They also did x-rays and removed bad teeth.

Wolves in zoos live longer because they get regular health checkups. Red wolves used to live in many places in the USA but had a hard time surviving. Zoologists(/zuˈɑːlədʒɪst/) are trying to protect(/prəˈtekt/) and reintroduce(/ˌriːɪntrəˈduːs/) them.
