The red wolf, a unique type of wolf in the USA, is making a slow comeback thanks to a breeding program.

Point Defiance(/dɪˈfaɪəns/) Zoo in Tacoma(/təˈkoʊmə/), Washington(/ˈwɑːʃɪŋtən/), helps by looking after their teeth. Broken teeth can make it hard for these wolves to eat properly(/ˈprɑːpərli/). Around 270 red wolves remain, most in zoos, and only 20 in the wild in eastern North Carolina(/ˌkærəˈlaɪnə/). The zoo’s vets(/vets/) gave the wolves dental checkups and cleaned their teeth. They also did x-rays and removed bad teeth.

Wolves in zoos live longer because they get regular health checkups. Red wolves used to live in many places in the USA but had a hard time surviving. Zoologists(/zuˈɑːlədʒɪst/) are trying to protect(/prəˈtekt/) and reintroduce(/ˌriːɪntrəˈduːs/) them.

Surgeons(/ˈsɜːrdʒən/) in New York accomplished(/əˈkɑːmplɪʃt/) the first-ever(史无前例) whole-eye transplant in a human. It is a historic breakthrough(/ˈbreɪkθruː/).

Aaron(/ˈærən/) James, a military(/ˈmɪləteri/) veteran(/ˈvetərən/), underwent(/ˌʌndərˈwent/) a surgery(/ˈsɜːrdʒəri/) which lasted 21 hours. The surgery was part of a partial(/ˈpɑːrʃ(ə)l/) face transplant after an electrical(/ɪˈlektrɪkl/) accident at work. The transplanted eye didn’t help Aaron see but it shows positive signs of health. Dr. Eduardo Rodriguez said that the surgery was a big success and he mentioned that people always thought that such surgery was not possible.

The transplanted eye currently doesn’t communicate with the brain, but the surgery’s success opens a new door for future possibilities in helping people see again.

Last Wednesday, Russian missiles(/ˈmɪsl/) hit the Ukrainian(/jʊˈkraɪnɪən/) capital of Kyiv. It happened just at the moment when doctors were doing an open-heart surgery on a 14-year-old boy.

Doctors were in the surgery when suddenly the lights started to flicker and the room went dark. Hospital staff quickly started a generator to get some electricity. The doctors couldn’t wait for more light, so they continued to work on the operation with only the light from their phones and headlamps. Luckily, the boy survived and he was doing well after the operation.

Russia admitted that it wanted to cut Kyiv off from electricity and water. The idea was to stop Ukraine’s fight and to negotiate(/nɪˈɡoʊʃieɪt/)谈判 with Russia.

Do you sometimes wonder where your lost belongings(所有物，财物；亲属) end up(结局)? They could be for sale at the Unclaimed(无人认领的) Baggage store in Alabama, California.


The store started operating over 50 years ago. This huge 4,600-square-meter(ˈhʌndrəd) store sells items left unclaimed by airlines for at least nine days. This is not a usual lost and found store, people come here to buy things which nobody wants. Doyle Owens founded(创办) the store in 1970, when he sold unclaimed baggage which he bought(/bɔːt/) in Washington(/ˈwɑːʃɪŋtən/) DC.

While 99.5% of bags usually find their owners. Owens sells or recycles the rest, or even puts it in a store museum.
