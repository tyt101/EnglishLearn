ok, let start it!

Today I studied English spelling. It contains four useful roles to help us improve english spelling and one strange spelling mistake. Part one is when to double consonants, there is a rule, If a word ends with a short vowel sound plus a consonant, and the stress is on the last, we should double consonants.

for example: 
hotter / jarring / saddest / cutting / winner

but if the final consonant is w or y ,don't double it 

for example: 
drawer / played
Part 2 is IE VS EI
I before E except after C ，that means in most cases, i goes before e,
for example piece / field / echieve. after the letter C, put e before i,
for example receipt / ceiling / conceive. Also if e goes before i to make an
/eI/ sound. for example: neighbour / weigh / eight.

Part 3 is S VS ES
If a word ends in -s / -ss / -z / -ch / -sh or -X, then you make the plural by adding -s for example: glasses / buses .

If a word ends in a consonant plus -o, then the plural is written, except some exceptions for example pianos / logos


Part 4 is fropping a final -e
